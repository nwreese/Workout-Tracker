# Workout Tracker
This application is a workout tracker created with MongoDB, Mongoose and Express. A user can view and track their daily workouts and log multiple exercises on a given day. If the user is doing resistance training, they can enter the name, weight, sets, reps, and duration. If the user is doing cardio, they can enter the name, distance and duration. The user can also view the total duration from the last week of workouts.
